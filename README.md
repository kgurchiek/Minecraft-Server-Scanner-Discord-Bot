## üìù About

This is the complete code for a Node.js Discord bot. This bot doesn't do the scanning itself, it just displays the scanned servers from my database, which is actively collected by a separate scanning program. You can access it yourself at <https://api.cornbread2100.com/servers> by sending a MongoDB find query in a POST request.

If you find any bugs, please report them in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/TSWcF2m67m).

You can contact me via Discord: [cornbread2100](https://discord.com/users/720658048611516559)

## üåê Hosting the bot yourself

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can try the bot on its [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/TSWcF2m67m) without hosting it.

Put the bot's token and client id from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) into `config.json`. If you're running your own instance of the scanner, you can host your own api with https://github.com/kgurchiek/Minecraft-Server-Scanner-API and enter the url into `config.json`. You can also change `displayURL` to make the bot use a different url in the API links exposed to users. This is useful if you have a public endpoint but internally want the bot to make a local or private connection. 

You'll need to install Node.js version v18 or later to run the bot. Then install all required dependencies with `npm i` and run `node deploy-commands` in your terminal to register the slash commands, otherwise they won't show up in Discord. Once everything is set up, run `node index` to start the bot. Each command should load, and "\[Bot\]" will be logged when it's ready.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to give the Discord bot the `bot` and `applications.commands` permissions in the URL generator.
